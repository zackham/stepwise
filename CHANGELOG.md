# Changelog

All notable changes to Stepwise are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Optional inputs** — `{from: "step.field", optional: true}` weak-reference bindings that resolve to `None` when the source dep is unavailable. Enables feeding data backward across loops, first-run defaults, and graceful degradation. Cycles in the dependency graph are valid if every cycle contains at least one optional edge.
- **Session continuity** — `continue_session: true` on agent/LLM steps reuses the same agent session across loop iterations instead of starting fresh. `loop_prompt` provides an alternate prompt for attempt > 1. `max_continuous_attempts` acts as a circuit breaker, forcing a fresh session with chain context backfill after N iterations.
- **Cross-step session sharing** — Agent steps with `continue_session` auto-emit `_session_id` as a typed output. Downstream steps receive it via optional input bindings to continue the same conversation. Engine serializes concurrent access via `_SessionLockManager`.

### Changed
- **Exit rule default behavior** — When explicit `advance` rules exist but none match, the step now **fails** instead of silently advancing. This prevents unhandled output cases from progressing through the DAG. Steps with only loop/escalate/abandon rules still implicitly advance when unmatched.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-17

**Server Management, Config Interpolation, Expression Fixes** — structured server commands and executor parameterization.

### Added
- **`stepwise server` subcommands** — `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status` replace the old `stepwise serve`. `--detach` for background mode, status shows PID/port/uptime/log path
- **Config interpolation** — executor config string values support `$variable` interpolation from resolved inputs, parameterizing model, command, system message, etc.
- **`stepwise diagram`** — DOT source no longer pollutes flow resolution (uses `pipe()`)

### Fixed
- **Single-output LLM steps** — skip `tool_choice` for steps with one output to prevent truncation; model responds naturally with JSON/text fallback
- **Cycle detection** — now accounts for loop back-edges, preventing false positives on valid loop targets
- **Expression namespace** — `true`/`false`/`null` aliases added (Python `True`/`False`/`None`)
- **For-each all-fail** — correct behavior when all fan-out instances fail
- **Cost reporting** — accurate token cost aggregation
- **Diagram port labels** — HTML line breaks in port node labels, no more overlap

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-16

**Pull-Based Branching, Poll Executor, Smooth DAG Camera** — conditional workflows and a polished live view.

### Added
- **`when` conditions** — steps declare their own activation condition evaluated against resolved inputs. Mutually exclusive branches, conditional gates, and skip propagation without explicit routing
- **`any_of` input bindings** — steps can depend on any one of multiple upstream steps, enabling merge points after conditional branches
- **`SKIPPED` step status** — steps that never activate are marked SKIPPED at job settlement, with a `STEP_SKIPPED` event
- **Poll executor** — `executor: poll` runs `check_command` at `interval_seconds`; JSON dict on stdout = fulfilled. For waiting on external conditions (PR reviews, deploys, etc.)
- **DAG camera** — critically damped spring with dead zone and target blending for smooth auto-follow. Zoom-to-fit active nodes (70–100%), slower pan lerp, extended active rect for human input popovers
- **Animated layout transitions** — DAG nodes interpolate position when the layout changes (expand/collapse, new steps)
- **Flows page** — dedicated page for browsing local flows, split from the editor
- **Local flow info panel** — three-column layout showing flow metadata, executor types, and description
- **Zombie job cleanup** — server fails jobs owned by dead processes on startup
- **`acpx` auto-install** — install script installs acpx when npm is available
- **`stepwise diagram`** — CLI command to render flow DAGs via graphviz

### Changed
- **Branching model rewrite** — removed the entire route system (`RouteSpec`, `RouteDefinition`, `_launch_route`). Replaced with pure-pull `when`-based branching. Exit rule `advance` with `target` replaced by `when` conditions on downstream steps
- Welcome flow rewritten using DAG branching primitives
- EditorPage simplified after FlowsPage extraction

### Fixed
- NaN/Infinity in SVG from layout transition and dagre
- Container port labels overlapping header and clipping at bottom
- Output port labels overflowing expanded container bottom
- `any_of` input bindings handled correctly in DAG layout
- Null job status handled gracefully in store

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-14

**CLI display overhaul** — rich, readable terminal output.

### Added
- **Live block rendering** — active steps redraw in place, completed steps scroll up permanently. No more interleaving of parallel for-each items
- **Output previews** — completed steps show `→ key: value` inline
- **For-each item labels** — `[data-model]`, `[api-routes]`, etc. group sub-steps under their item
- **Loop icon** — `⟳` for retry attempts
- **`stepwise welcome`** — interactive post-install demo prompt

### Changed
- Install script uses `--force --reinstall` for reliable upgrades
- Cleaner post-install message with copy-pasteable commands

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-14

**Async Engine, Live DAG, Agent Emit Flow** — real-time execution with dynamic workflows.

### Added
- **AsyncEngine** — event-driven engine replaces tick-based polling. Parallel step dispatch via `asyncio.Queue`, executor runs in thread pool. No more tick interval
- **Agent Emit Flow** — agent steps with `emit_flow: true` can dynamically create sub-workflows by writing `.stepwise/emit.flow.yaml`. Engine launches emitted flow as sub-job and propagates results back. Supports iterative delegation with exit rule loops
- **CLI Server Delegation** — `stepwise run` auto-delegates to a running server for lower latency. `--wait` and `--async` modes use WebSocket for live updates, falling back to REST polling
- **Job Ownership** — `created_by`, `runner_pid`, `heartbeat_at` fields track who owns each job. Stale detection for orphaned CLI jobs. Server adoption via `POST /api/jobs/{id}/adopt`
- **Typed Human Inputs** — `OutputFieldSchema` with `type: choice|number|text`, validation, auto-generated UI controls in web and CLI
- **Follow-Flow Mode** — DAG view auto-pans to track active steps at 100% zoom
- **Welcome Flow** — interactive product tour: plan, implement (for-each), test (retry loops), review (route steps), deploy. Available as `@stepwise:welcome` from registry
- **`STEPWISE_ATTEMPT`** — attempt number exposed as env var to script executors
- **Inline Human Input** — human step panels render directly below suspended DAG nodes
- **Auto-Expand Sub-Jobs** — delegated sub-flows and for-each instances expand automatically in the DAG
- **Animated DAG Edges** — intake and loopback edges animate with glow and flowing dashes for active steps
- **Data Flow Labels** — artifact values shown on DAG edges with hover tooltips
- **Settings Page** — model labels, API keys, default model configuration in the web UI
- **Billing Mode** — `billing: subscription` skips cost limit enforcement for subscription users
- **IOAdapter** — unified CLI output abstraction (PlainAdapter, QuietAdapter, TerminalAdapter)
- 500+ new tests (1144 total)

### Changed
- Server uses `AsyncEngine` instead of tick-based `Engine`
- `ThreadSafeStore` with `_LockedConnection` proxy serializes all SQLite calls
- Removed `/api/tick` endpoint (no longer needed)
- Install and README quickstart now lead with `@stepwise:welcome` demo

- **Flow directories** — flows can now be directories containing `FLOW.yaml` alongside co-located scripts, prompts, and docs. Single-file `.flow.yaml` still works everywhere
- **Name-based flow resolution** — CLI commands accept flow names: `stepwise run my-flow` resolves across project root, `flows/`, `.stepwise/flows/`
- **`stepwise new <name>`** — scaffolds a flow directory from a minimal template
- **`prompt_file:`** — load prompt content from file relative to flow directory at parse time
- **Script path resolution** — `run:` paths resolve relative to flow directory for directory flows
- **Registry bundles** — `stepwise share` bundles directory flows as structured JSON with size/count limits
- **`.origin.json`** — provenance tracking when flows are installed from the registry
- `flow_resolution.py`, `bundle.py`, `editor_llm.py` — new modules
- Editor API endpoints: `/api/local-flows`, `/api/flows/local/{path}`, `/api/flows/parse`, `/api/flows/patch-step`, `/api/flows/add-step`, `/api/flows/delete-step`, `/api/editor/chat`, `/api/registry/*`
